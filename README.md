I created a 'Wordle Assistor' application to help present potential guesses for the New York Times Wordle game.

To use the application, begin typing the first guess used in Wordle. Once entered and the guess moved to the 'guess' section, click on the letters to toggle through if they are included in the word or in the correct location.

The 'Potential Words' section shows all remaining words in the Wordle dictionary that can be used. You can either type the next guess or click one of the words in this list to add it to the guess section
